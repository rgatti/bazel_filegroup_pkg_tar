Testing Bazel pkg_tar with a filegroup

When a filegroup points directly to a file or uses the glob() function pkg_tar
correctly recognizes subdirectory changes. When a filegroup points directly to
a directory updates to files in the directory are not picked up by pkg_tar.

Tested using Bazel version:

WARNING: --batch mode is deprecated. Please instead explicitly shut down your Bazel server using the command "bazel shutdown".

To test:

1. Clone this repo
2. Run ./test.sh

The test.sh:

A simple script that runs a pkg_tar target twice. On each run the src/data file
is updated. This test is run twice, the first time on a target using the glob()
function, the second time on a target that isn't.
